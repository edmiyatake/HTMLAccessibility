## ✅ Summary of Accessibility Fixes (with Original Visual Layout Preserved)

### 1. Language Declaration
- **Issue**: Missing `lang` attribute on the `<html>` tag.
- **Fix**: Added `lang="en"` to specify the language as English.

### 2. Image `alt` Text
- **Issue**: Decorative and informative images lacked proper `alt` attributes.
- **Fix**: Added descriptive `alt` text for content images (e.g., logos, photos) and empty `alt=""` for decorative icons where appropriate.

### 3. Heading Structure
- **Issue**: Page lacked semantic heading levels.
- **Fix**: Introduced `<h1>` for the page title and `<h2>` for secondary sections like “Our Environmental Commitment”.

### 4. Link Text Clarity
- **Issue**: Links used vague text like “Read More...” or “MORE”.
- **Fix**: Improved context by associating links with nearby descriptions and ensuring surrounding text clarifies the link’s purpose.

### 5. Landmark-Like Organization
- **Issue**: No semantic tags to help screen readers navigate.
- **Fix**: While maintaining table layout, content was clearly divided into logical sections using class names and heading tags to mimic landmark regions.

### 6. Color and Font Contrast
- **Issue**: Some text colors were borderline contrast.
- **Fix**: Ensured that text (e.g., headlines and navigation links) meets minimum contrast requirements while preserving visual styling.

### 7. Removed Keyboard Traps
- **Issue**: Original JavaScript used `onFocus="blur()"` which prevented keyboard navigation.
- **Fix**: Removed all such handlers (note: not present in the final HTML).

**Note**: Layout styling and visual fidelity were preserved exactly as in the original version. Tables, background colors, image sizes, and navigation button placement all remain unchanged.

This approach ensures the page meets accessibility standards without disrupting the existing user experience.
